Attached, please find  :



1.	An example of a report and slides for internship evaluation.

In addition, 



1.	You may use templates in Word/PowerPoint to create your résumé (CV), or use Overleaf [LaTeX](www.overleaf.com <http://www.overleaf.com/> ), which has great and easy-to-use templates. 

2.	Check out the following job search websites: LinkedIn (1), https://www.jobteaser.com/fr <https://www.jobteaser.com/fr>  (2), https://www.glassdoor.fr/index.html <https://www.glassdoor.fr/index.html>  (3), https://www.welcometothejungle.com/fr <https://www.welcometothejungle.com/fr>  (4), https://www.monster.fr/ <https://www.monster.fr/>  (5), https://www.indeed.com/ <https://www.indeed.com/>  (6),https://www.stagiaires.ma  (6) and https://www.internships.com/ <https://www.internships.com/>  (7) 

3.	

	Don't forget to reach out to people close to you, such as family and professors, as they may have internship opportunities available. 

4.	

	Cold Emailing/Contacting could be very effective : Reach out to companies or individuals who work in your field of interest, even if they don't have a current posting. (try searching on Google or LinkedIn using key words that interest you then try to get the companies sites / employees contacts infos)





5.	Keep an eye on company websites for job postings and contact information for people who work there, as they may be able to assist you with your internship search. 

6.	Be patient and try different methods to improve your search and application process. Occasionally, evaluate your weak points and work on them. As we all know , this is a personal experience that varies for each person, but perseverance is the key. 



Best regards, 



Chaddi
